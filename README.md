# cqueue
A water clear, plain simple, FIFO queue.

The code is documented on itself, so everything is explained in the source files themselves.
To use, just:

1. Use #define VAL_TYPE to the vaue you want to use in your queue.
2. Use #include "cqueue.h"

If you intent to use a custom struct in the queue, just declare it before step 1.

That is it. You have a versatile, simple and efficient FIFO/Queue ready for use.
Have fun!

PS:
 simple-queue-ex.c is a simple example using integers in the queue.
 bfs-queue-ex.c is a implementation of Breadth-First Search algorithm using cqueue.h to create and process the graph.
